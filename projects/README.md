## x86_sandbox Use this project to:
* Compile a program for your host machine
* Run unit-tests for code modules

## The code contains source, header and unit-test files for two coding questions 
### Coding Question 1 - Implement the divide function (with all possible error checks)
* This question contain one source(coding_question1.c) and one header file(coding_question1.h)
1. @projects->x86_sandbox->coding_question1.c 
2. @projects->x86_sandbox->coding_question1.h 
* Corresponding test cases is written in the test_divide.c file in the test folder. 
1. @projects->x86_sandbox->test->test_divide.c
* The two inputs for divide function can be changed by the following line of code from the source file

```
static const unsigned number_divided_by = 3;
static const unsigned number_to_be_divided = 2000;
```

### Coding Question 2 - Manage timers list
* This question contain one source(coding_question2.c) and one header file(coding_question2.h)
1. @projects->x86_sandbox->coding_question2.c 
2. @projects->x86_sandbox->coding_question2.h 
* Corresponding test cases is written in the test_timercallback.c file in the test folder. 
1. @projects->x86_sandbox->test->test_timercallback.c
